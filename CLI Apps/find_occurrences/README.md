# Project Name

Find Occurrences

## Description

This project is a simple Python script that reads a text file and searches for occurrences of specific words in it. It provides a function `find_occurrences` that counts the occurrences of words and identifies the lines where the words are present. The script takes two command-line arguments: the file to be searched and a file containing a list of words to be counted. The output is a dictionary where each key represents a word from the word set, and its corresponding value is a tuple with the count of occurrences of that word and the lines where it appears.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash

## Usage

```bash
python find_occurrences.py <search_file> <words_file>
```

- `<search_file>`: The name of the file to be searched.
