# PWC

The `wc` command counts the number of characters, words, and lines in a file, and also indicates the size of the longest line in the file. When used with a large set of files, the `wc` command can have some performance issues.

This project aims to develop the `pwc` (parallel wc) command, a version of `wc`that performs the line, word, and character counting in parallel.
